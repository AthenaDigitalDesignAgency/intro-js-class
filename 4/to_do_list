Intro - I got this from bootstrap
	- just saved it and then modified it a little bit

centering things using bootstrap
	text-center class

	grid 
		col-md-2
		col-md-8 <- centered 
		col-md-2

style sheet 

1. warm up: make the bullet points disappear on 4.html with css
2. make buttons work on 4.html
3. As a class go over 4-ex1.html 4-ex2.html, 4-ex3.html

In resumes.html 
	- make it so checkValue() function only happens on click of the button on resumes
	- Put spaces in there for dog and using break points show the value of check - then go over trim $.trim()
	- Change the text from dog to city 
	- Make this happen inside the checkValue() function to the commented out images
		$('#image').html("<img src='http://media.giphy.com/media/7d7Tow15pX0Uo/giphy.gif' alt='under dog'>");


	- make the loop in resumes.html only loop over the colors list
	- go over $(this) by doing:
		if ($(this).text() == 'blue'){
			alert($(this).text());
		}
	- As a class go over break points in chrome (via sources in developer tools) by hiding the li tags via putting a break point on the console.log and doing $(this).hide();
		- remind class to pay attention carefully as they'll be repeating these steps
	- Ask each group to do what I did
	- When clicking on the list button - have the list elements change to the color they say they are 
		- use if statements
		- use $(this)


in startups.html

	- go here and show them how costly it is:
	<!--link: http://www.bounceexchange.com/?#pricing -->

	- go over incrementing a counter on the screen
		use console.logs to demonstrate

	- don't let the pop up come up more than once with a counter

	- make the modal appear only on exit - so no need for the button or the on click event

	- make it so that the modal can be triggered only after 5 seconds

	- next steps would be using a cookie so that it only triggers once for someone while visiting your page
