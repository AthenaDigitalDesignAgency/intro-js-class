For your game (do the ones you haven't done yet)
	Put in an upward variable into your game
		- an example would be a score

		- put a variable into your game that goes up as long as the player selects the correct options

		- display this variable in the html

		- make it so if the player trys the game again, the variable gets reset to the original value.

	Put in a downward variable into your game
		- an example would be food. You start off with 10, then it goes down.

		- put a variable into your game that goes down unless the player selects the correct options

		- display this variable in the html

		- make it so if the variable reaches 0, then your player dies

		- make it so if the player trys the game again, the variable gets reset to the original value.

	Style your game so it appears visually appealing
		- update the css
		- update how the questions and choices appear
		- update the choice button
		- the background (maybe use subtle patterns (google it))
